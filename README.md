## System Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **User Input**: Loan application data is submitted through a web app.
2. **Data Messaging**: Backend sends data to a Pub/Sub topic for processing.
3. **Prediction Processing**: Google Cloud Functions trigger ML model predictions.
4. **Storage**: Results stored in Firestore under a unique application ID.
5. **Result Retrieval**: Predictions are displayed to users in real-time.

### Technical Components
- **Frontend**: User-friendly web interface for data submission and result display.
- **Backend**:
  - **Google Cloud Pub/Sub**: Message broker for asynchronous data processing.
  - **Google Cloud Functions**: Prediction processing and storage.
  - **Google Firestore**: Real-time data syncing and storage.
